 # The Brewery Hub
 Welcome to The Brewery Hub! An online Single Page Application that allows users to search a brewery by name, view individual brewery details, filter different brewerys by type as well as add a brewery to a Favorite List. The application is designed using JavaScript, HTML and CSS and utilizes The Open Brewery DB API.

 Here is a live link to The Brewery Hub application: <https://sandramisigo.github.io/Brewery-HUB/>


 ## Project Learning Goals
   1. To design and architect features across a frontend.
   2. To communicate and collaborate in a technical environment.
   3. To intergrate Javascript to an external API.
   4. To debug issues in small to medium sized projects.
   5. To build and iterate on a project MVP.


 ## Project Requirements
   1. A single Page Application with a HTML,JavaScipt and CSS frontend.
   2. The app should access data from a public API. 
   3. Have 3 distinct event listener as;
           * Search
           * Filter
           * Add 
   4. Implement at least one Array Iteration Method such as:
           * Map
           * forEach
           * filter.
   5. Follow good coding practices. Keeping the code DRY.


 ## Project Setup

  1. Creating Project Folder: 
  2. Initializing a Git repository to track changes.
  3. Regularly commiting code to the repository to maintain a clean history and facilitate backups.


 ## Core Deliverables

  1. **Search for a Brewery by Name** 
    - Users can type in the search bar the name of a specific brewery. The app then fetches matching data from the OPEN BREWERY DB API and displays it on the web page.
  2. **Filtering Brewerys**
    - Users can filter through brewerys by type.All they have to do is click a drop down menu and the brewery types will be displayed such as: nano, proprietor,micro,contract and brewpub. Selecting one means only the brewery type with matching data will be displayed.
  3. **Viewing Brewery Details**
    - Clicking a single brewery on the list enables one to view its details such as:
      * type
      * address
      * contact
      * website     
  4. **Adding Brewery to a Favorite List**
    - After scrolling through a list of brewerys, a user can add their favorite brewery to a Favorites List. In case they want to visit the brewery, they can always refer to their Favorite List.
  5. **Load Brewerys** 
    - This allows users to view all the brewerys on the web page.


  ## Project Structure
      1. **OPEN BREWERY DB**: Provides the brewery data used in the app.
      2. **index.html**: Contains the basic HTML structure and layout of the web page.
      3. **style.css**: This ensures basic styling is done to the application layout such as font size, color etc.
      4. **index.js**: This is where DOM manipulation, event handling, and server communications are handled.
    

  ## Getting Started

  ## Setup Instructions

      1. **Clone the Repository:**

       * git clone [https://github.com/sandramisigo/Brewery-HUB](https://github.com/sandramisigo/Brewery-HUB)

      2. **Navigate to the project directory**

      3. **Open the Application:**

       * Open the `index.html` in your browser to view and interact with the app.

  ## Challenges
      * Design challenge since creating an interface that allows a user to filter brewery by type was not so easy.
      * Limited data since OPEN BREWERY DB API doesn't always have complete data for every brewery.

  ##  Future plans
     * Turn the project to a mobile app.
     * Expand data sources.

  ## **Conclusion**

    This project provides a simple and yet effective way to interact with your best brewery. You search a brewery and easily add it to a 'Favorites List' in order to reach out in future. The project is ideal for practicing basic front-end development skills, including DOM manipulation, event handling among others.
